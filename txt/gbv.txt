Disarm the settlers
The new drunk drivers
Have hoisted the flag
We are with you in your anger
Proud brothers
Do not fret
The bus will get you there yet
To carry us to the lake
The club is open
Yeah, The club is open
Hey, the club is open
A-come on, come on, the club is open
C'mon, c'mon, the club is open
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, the club is open...

I can't terrorize I see terror in your eyes
As we go up, we go down
I can't socialize I'll be institutionalized
As we go up, we go down
And see the truth, yeah, is just a lie, oh
And see the truth, yeah, is just a lie, oh
I speak in monotone: "Leave my fucking life alone"
As we go up we go down
As we go up we go down (And see the truth yeah)
As we go up we go down (Is just a lie)
As we go up we go down (And see the truth yeah)
As we go up we go down (Is just a lie)

Tower to the skies
An academy of lies
And what goes up surely must come down
And we felt the mighty blowout with the walls coming down
Or something like that
Most of us are quite pleased
With the same old song
And all of a sudden I'm relatively sane
With everything to lose and nothing to gain
Or something like that
Men of wisdom
And men of compromise
Men of weak flesh in an armored disguise
All fall down
"If it's right you can tell"
Echos Myron like a siren
With endurance like the liberty bell
And he tells you of the dreamers, but he's cracked up like the road
And he'd like to lift us up, but we're a very heavy load
And we're finally here
And shit yeah, it's cool
And shouldn't it be
Or something like that...

I've waited too long to have you
Hide in the back of me
I've cheated so long I wonder
How you keep track of me
You could never be strong
You can only be free
And I never asked for the truth
But you owe that to me
I've entered the game of pricks
With knives in the back of me
Can't call you or on you no more
When they're attacking me
I'll climb up on the house
Weep to water the trees
And when you come calling me down
I'll put on my disease
You could never be strong
You can only be free
And I've never asked for the truth
But you owe that to me
And I've never asked for the truth
But you owe that to me
And I've never asked for the truth
But you owe that to me

If I waited for you
To signify the moves that I should make
I'll be on the take
Gold star for robot boy
Well then that's ok
If I waited for you
To show me all the actions I should take
Would I get my break?
Gold star for robot boy
And it's one thing
And it's something to do
The robot boy yeah
If I waited for lessons
In true confessions that could take all day
But I'm here to stay
Gold star for robot boy
Well then that's my move
Well then that's my move
Well then that's my move
But it's one thing
Yeah it's something to do
The robot boy yeah
If I waited for you
To signify the moves that I should make
I'll be on the take
Gold star for robot boy
Well then that's okay

Sitting out on your house
Watching hardcore ufo's
Drawing pictures, playing solos til ten
Are you amplified to rock?
Are you hoping for a contact?
I'll be with you, without you, again
Turn and run, the angel's calling
You say when and i say i'm falling
Up and down through broken down buildings
Back and forth but please don't bother at all
Count the days that we have wasted from the start
Speak the words and build a playground
In your head
Turn and run, the angel's calling
You say when and i say i'm falling
Up and down through broken down buildings
Back and forth but you know why i left you for so long
You know why i left you for so long...

I met a non-dairy creamer
Explicitly laid out like a fruitcake
With a wet spot
Bigger than a great lake
Took me to the new church
And baptized me with salt
She told me, "liquor"
I am a new man
Hot freaks
This one is on the house
This one is better than ever
I walked into the house of miraculous recovery
And stood before king everything
And he asked me to join him in the red wing
Took me to pie land
Said, "i'm a thigh man"
I will be eternally hateful
Hot freaks
Hot freaks
Hot freaks
This one is on the house
This one is better than ever
And this one is on the house
This one is better than ever
This one is on the house
This one is better than ever

I am a scientist - I seek to understand me
All of my impurities and evils yet unknown
I am a journalist - I write to you to show you
I am an incurable
And nothing else behaves like me
And I know what's right
But I'm losing sight
Of the clues for which I search and choose
To abuse
To just unlock my mind
Yeah, and just unlock my mind
I am a pharmacist
Prescriptions I will fill you
Potions, pills and medicines
To ease your painful lives
I am a lost soul
I shoot myself with rock & roll
The hole I dig is bottomless
But nothing else can set me free
I am a scientist - I seek to understand me
I am an incurable and nothing else behaves like me
Everything is right
Everything works out right
Everything fades from sight
Because that's alright with me

Someone tell me why I do the things
That I don't want to do
When you're around me I'm somebody else

Someone tell me why I act like a fool
When things don't go my way
When you're around me I'm somebody else

There is no reason I guess
Having it once gone too far
When you clean out the hive
Does it make you wonder why
Are you still being followed
By the teenage FBI

Someone tell me why
Someone tell me why
Someone tell me why I do the things
That I don't wanna do
When you're around me I'm somebody else

Bitter fish in crude oil sea
You don't have to bother me
You just have to join in on this song

Crawling people on your knees
Don't take this so seriously
You just have to hum it all day long

To dine alone
To build a private zone
Or trigger a synapse
And free us from our traps

You won't see me turn my back
With my head against my stack
Spitting teeth and breaking open skin

Official ironmen you are free
Champions officially
But you won't catch me on an open chin


To dine alone
To build a private zone
Or trigger a synapse
And free us from our traps

Save your knock-out punches for the freaks
Happy little babies with red cheeks
You will rock them gently out of sync

Confirmations through the wire
Spitting gas into the fire
Am I also worthy of a drink?

To dine alone
To build a private zone
Or trigger a synapse
And free us from our traps

Why is it every time I think about you
Something that you have said or implied makes me doubt you
Then I look into your cynical eyes and I know it
As if it never meant anything to me

Parallel lines on a slow decline - tractor rape chain
Better yet, let's all get wet on the tractor rape chain
Speed up, slow down, go all around in the end

In the first place it's probably just paranoia
But there's a ghost in my room and he says I better run
It's a thing I know - It's a thing I believe in
Won't you tell it to go away?

Parallel lines on a slow decline - tractor rape chain
Better yet, let's all get wet on the tractor rape chain
Speed up, slow down, go all around in the end
Speed up, slow down, go all around in the end

Watch me jumpstart as the old skin is peeled
See an opening and bust into the field
Hidden longings no longer concealed
Watch me bulldoze every bulldozer away
Each new obstacle from each old new day
Where it's going it's hard for me to say

And shoot me down
And bring me down
But I won't be around
As you run through the places you love
I remember the faces that cry
And they're pulling me back so I have to die

And watch me jumpstart at the first light of day
Each new sensation just blows me away
Don't look now, don't look now, I'm a phase
Straight from ground zero, X marks the spot
I can't pretend to be something I'm not
Cause I'm a supernova erect and white hot



And watch me jumpstart I'm Maximum Jack
Shot through the cosmos like an alien attack
Film finished, fade into black

Long Live Rockathon
Offspring and Tag alongs were finding
The history book has lost its binding
Pages everywhere
Two Titans without care will read them
We conjure ghosts and then we feed them
And if it all goes well we'll laugh a lot
And then take photographs
Of what we made, lemonade
Freedomcake quick to bake
Trim the tree collectively
Breath the air from the fair
And watch colored lights shine down
Dancing round the lady's face
As we learned the sound
We can't keep this violent pace
Though we know that haste makes waste
And I'm giving you a ring
For the dreams of the weed king we all sing

14 cheerleader coldfront
Point your nose beyond
Creeping boys in alleys
Find them when you're gone

Stick close to locker rooms
And wavy clothes to wear
You will hold them dear
To something queer and stare

16 used companions
Have nowhere to stay
Give them access to parking spaces
No coin meters there

Stick close to locker rooms
And wavy clothes to wear
You will hold them dear
To something queer and stare

You will hold them dear
To something queer and stare

Taken aside and lectured on how the people do not act
When forced and revealing hidden charms
The last text on village firearms
Loads of creamy music and lots of time to make it
Behind the steamy newsroom - they wouldn't dare to fake it
Lasting forever through radioactive weather
Do what you do - shake what it is
Add'em up - yeah! !158 years of beautiful sex

Oh, to speak on one's feet
To beat on one's brain
The popular mechanics are at it again
A tenement filled with side-show freaks
Assembled to downgrade
An impeccable arrangement
By the soft-rock renegades
And give me time to light
A sentimental torch tonight
I'm a big fan of the pigpen

Sharper than most
Cut with exacto
Gone is all good
Ex post facto
Ba-da-ba-da...

Many years we spent unpressured
That we knew so swell
Love in times of simple pleasures
Only time would tell
Oh, this is not to say
We are not the way we used to be
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

We were not so fond of reason
Everyone could tell
Even times we'd start to stumble
But never ever fell
Oh, this is not to say
We were not the worst we've ever been
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Fools and kings decide
Ways to live your life
This is just the way we want to be

Full head of nothing
Fail to see the difference
Fail to feel the mercy
Off to join the flagstaff
Always crush me
Picture my amazement
When it doesn't always pain me
And I will reproduce faster

Commitment trailblazer
Your trail is quite a puzzle
And you are such a daredevil
And you are such a collector
Always crush me
Picture my amazement
When it doesn't always pain me
And I will reproduce faster

Post-punk X-Man parked his fork-lift
Like a billion stars flickering from the grinder's wheel
Lower hybrid clad in metal
In subgroup tools
Excused from schools
To fathom hell
See you now
Echo and his brother (Echo and his brother)
Fish and Peter the Pig
Will meet where it's big
Auditorium

You chose a giant step - caught your eye
Guaranteed sweetness that you thought broken
And you were not fine
And bearing in mind
Other ones that you could have wed
And hopefully dread

And i wouldn't dare to
Bring out this
Awful bliss

No, I wouldn't dare to
Bring out this
Awful bliss

No, I wouldn't dare to
Bring out this
Awful bliss

Will the wind that scatters dust
Reveal its secrets, speak to us
Of many things?
In the morning when she comes
The bird who wakes you with her song
She'll beat her wings
She will rise again

And ride a perfect high
And find a sweet seed growing
And never know why
She sees anything

One more inch for no more reason
Go without you even yet
And death you sing
Pass it by with once discovered
Time to stop wasting time
What will you bring?
You will rise again

And ride a perfect high
And find a sweet seed growing
And never know why
You hear anything

Bless the sunlight
Grab this day to make you over
Save the bullet
Price the sandman's head
This time do not roll over
Beat your wings
Yeah, hear them sing
Of up there in the glimpse of silence
Up there

When the days have come to pass
Our journey broken, gone at last
We'll beat our wings
Shadows take familiar skin
So recognize them, don't give in
We'll beat our wings
We will rise again

And ride a perfect high
And find a sweet seed growing
And never know why
We feel anything
Yeah, anything
Yeah, beat your wings
Yeah, beat your wings

How can I look through
Their senseless side?
As much as I'd like to
All is not right - and it shows
All around you
Under the tree - a seed
Come in closer
There is a sign
Shaped in the mind

Pick up
For God's sake
When we call you
Back to the lake

How can I tell you
All that is wrong
Nothing invites you
Can't get along - with you now
And I try to
There is a page
It's still unwritten
Why can't you find
Time in your schedule
To pick up...

Oh, pick up
For God's sake
When we call you
Back to the lake

Make no mistake
We will call you
Back to the lake

Introducing the amazing Rockethead
You know what the deal is dude
Excuse me, Napoleon

But I gotta know
Why I gotta stand
In a hallway
In a highway
Where nothing goes my way

Well, I'm going out
Well, I'm going in
To the Big Chief's place
Gonna slap his factory down

Blimps go 90 on with the show
Couldn't you see that?
Now didn't you know?
Aerosol halos---films of the flag
Rifle games for seven-year-olds
What a drag
Yeah now that's a drag

This is not a vacation
There is no place to go
Weep, sad freaks of the nation
Where blimps go 90
And you can't find me

Senator sipping on Gentleman Jack
"Oh boy" they told me "now don't you look back"
But don't you worry
I promise to not
I'll join your Canary Court
Fit into the slot
Say now what have you got?

Oftentimes I'm reminded
Of the sweet young days
When I poured punch for the franchise
And thus was knighted
Got so excited

Blimps go 90 on with the show
Couldn't you see that?
Now didn't you know?
Hey now didn't you know?

I played the part
I played the start
I made a table out of clay
I placed my hands upon the plans
I waited for a proud display
I played around
I heard the sound of certain trouble on the way

I got bulldog skin

I took a car
I drove it far
I dug the quality of steel
I crashed my nerve
I made it swerve
I made it back - was no big deal
I tasted blood
A date with scud
And now I don't know how to feel

I got bulldog skin
(Spark from the master)

The lifeblood lighthouse flashing
Sixteen chicks remain on watch
For the wheels to come rolling in
And they do
Yes they always do
I'd be bored and dissapointed if they didn't

Buzzards and dreadful crows
Right on the tip of my nose
They wait like cats and fly out
For the light in my eyes to die out
And it does
Yes it always does
I'd be shocked and removed if it didn't

Buzzards and dreadful crows
A neccessary evil I suppose
There's something in this deal for everyone
Did you really think you were the only one?

Captain's dead
The war machine has fled
The people have gone home
Remember what he said
And you won't feel alone

You won't remember at this time tomorrow
When all the sorrow has gone
A pull of the lever and nothing's forever
We'll ride to the heart of the sun

Captain's dead
The war machine has fled
The people have gone home
Remember what he said
And you won't feel alone

You won't remember at this time tomorrow
When all the sorrow has gone
A pull of the lever and nothing's forever
We'll ride to the heart of the sun

Captain's dead
Captain's dead
Captain's dead
Captain's dead

Trailing off the likes of it
She likes it when it grows
Sending out a candidate
She's sinking her foes
Peaking out then leveling
Wherever it goes

And her mother will greet you
And a river will reach you
Breaking out to make you slave again

Chasing Heather crazy
Chasing Heather crazy
Making sure that all the world is coming down
All the world is coming down on her
Anywhere I want to
And if you want to come too
We'll go down where
All the girls are stumblin' round
All the world is crumbling down around her

Staring out from otherworldly windows painted red
Doesn't have to listen to the voices in your head
That's a different lie
Do you remember what was said?

And her mother will greet you
And a river will reach you
Breaking out to make you slave again

Chasing Heather crazy
Chasing Heather crazy
Making sure that all the world is coming down
All the world is coming down on her
Anywhere I want to
And if you want to come too
We'll go down where
All the girls are stumblin' round
All the world is crumbling down around her

Shoot up on the fast lane
She falls like a concrete robot
She's a boy
Billy-I
Billy-L
Billy-L
Billy-Y
Billy-I Billy-L Billy-L Billy-Y

Chain smoke rings like a vapor snake kiss
She says she don't know why
The closer you are the quicker it hits you
Closer you are the quicker it hits you
Now you can see the boys dreaming, scheming. . 

You play the heavy
It's a real slick movie move
"Stoned at the Alamo" tonight
The closer you are the quicker it hits you
Try to be nice and look what it gets you
Now you can see the boys dreaming, scheming. . 

I get up at seven o'clock
And drive myself up to the Lookout Rock
The closer you are the quicker it hits you
The closer you are the quicker it hits you
Now you can see the boys dreaming, scheming. . 
The closer you are the quicker it hits you
The closer you are the quicker it hits you...

Do you suppose she could change your life?
If she could then I wish she would
Do you suppose she could save my life?
If she could then I think she should

It's another busy day for the cut-out witch
Silver threads for her hands, need another stitch
Cold needles in her eyes, then we realize
It's another busy day for the cut-out witch

I wish she'd change this wrong into a right
Say pretty please and I think she might
Cause if she won't, then you'll fall, and bust
And turn to dust, so I think, she must

It's another busy day for the cut-out witch
Silver threads for her hands, need another stitch
Cold needles in her eyes, then we realize
It's another busy day for the cut-out witch

Do you think she can change your life?
Do you think she can change your life?
Do you think she can change your life?

Deliver this message to the one i love the most
I've lost all my money to a 300 pound ghost
Squeaky was a sad child - the product of neglect
Got stoned by a jellyfish demanding her respect

Demons are real
They are standing still
Demons are real
They are standing still

At times I wish I were dead
Busy people dancing all over my head
Real shock value with every move they make
Real bad headache with every step they take

I get a contact buzz
Can't remember what the problem was
I find it hard to even care
Life was too real till you got there

My life is dirt, but you seem to make it cleaner
Reduced my felony to a misdemeanor
When I feel sick, you’re an antibiotic
Organize my world when it was pointless and chaotic

I get a contact buzz
Can't remember what the problem was
I find it hard to even care
Life was too real until you got there

Jimmy was a fly
Got sucked in by an actor
And wrapped in a cocoon
And skin-tight buffoonery
Now here's the plan...

Scene from ester's day
Of running backward courses
With a horse of different forces
Lying wings of films
That seem to never see the screen
Couldn't bear to face their dreams

Down and out
Couldn't bear to shout it out

Brought up on the road
A sparkle shiny diner
Is the home for wayward minor
In a flying car that seems
To whisper in an ear
Let's just go get out of here

Down and out
Couldn't bear to shout it out

Down and out
Couldn't bear to shout it out...

Clouds open dust and waves rise up to obscure
God's very blue sky
People skating gingerly only endure
Cause they don't have the sunlight

Lines of shopping mothers grabbing the kids
Pushing up to the front
Rows of pretty little houses and lawns
I want you to have a beautiful one

Moving in circles out on the freeway, yeah
Coming and going to everyday
Everyday, everyday, every way
Moving in circles out on the freeway
Coming and going to everyday

Got a brand new car with hideaway lights
And a blue racing stripe
Costs a little extra but it's worth it to me
When money burns through the exhaust pipe

I'd like to take you for a quick spin sometime
To show you what it's got
I can't believe you chose to work in the line
But I'm so glad that I'm not

Eyeline the driveway
Eyeblack the door
Sky all around me
Levels life from roof to floor

Trees and knees are lovely
Seek it, find the core
I have grown to life
Like all in silence, wait for more

Everywhere with helicopter
Hard to follow when I'm slow
Everywhere with helicopter
Sending off where lightning goes

I will try to fight them
I will let them nowhere to go
Try escape the pace
I'll say God bless you, let me know

We know the answers
We fill us in
I do not diminish
Start to finish, front to end

Everywhere with helicopter
Hard to swallow when I'm slow
Everywhere with helicopter
Censor of the lightning ghosts

Everywhere with helicopter
Hard to swallow when I'm slow
Everywhere with helicopter
Sending off where lightning goes

I am breathing, yet I feel no sky
Things without wings have begun to fly

Unhitched trailers---I see trailers trail
From the well I pull an empty pail

Little man bleeding, little heart beating so
Evil speaker blow my circuits---oh no

Brothers, sisters---all transistors, you know
Father logic sometimes gets cosmic, you know

I don't know where I've come from
I don't know where I'm off to
I need to find a way out
He's here to help me find it

Exit flagger
Exit flagger
Exit flagger
Exit flagger
I'm not going to race you today

I need a life as same as
I don't believe in anything
I promise to leave you one of these days
I promise it'll be real soon

Exit flagger
Exit flagger
Exit flagger
Exit flagger
I'm not going to race you today

I promise to leave you
I promise to leave you
I promise to leave you
I promise to leave you

She's slender
Oh, she's cream
She's face
I took her from place to place
I moved her from room to room
I exploited her
Became the groom
So I write music for soundtracks now
I write music for soundtracks now
(That's what I wanted to do anyhow)

I took her from place to place
I took her from room to room
So I know, yeah...

Under the iron shop
The farewell ladies wink
Always promising
No one to crush them
Always pokerfaced before bingo
Does it snap or just happen?

But a queen's prize awaits
She might rub her legs
But a queen's prize awaits

Currently fabulous
And perhaps at last
The song you sing will have meaning

But a queen's prize awaits
She might rub her legs
But a queen's prize awaits
She might rub her legs

Here come the fantasy creeps
They're all around you
They're here to give you the creeps
They've come to hound you

Here come the fantasy creeps
Thick walls, they pound through
They know where everyone sleeps
I'm glad they found you

Hey, glad girls only want to get you high
And they're alright

There will be no coronation
There will be no flowers flowing
In the light that passes though me

Hey, glad girls only want to get you high
And they're alright

There will be no graduation
There will be no trumpets blowing
In the light that passes through me

With the sinking of the sun
I've come to greet you
Clean your hands and go to sleep
Confess the dreams
Of good and bad men all around
Some are lost
And some have found
The light that passes though me

I’m sitting on two heads
"Some seat" I heard some said
Just waiting for Sunday
Four days after Wednesday

The higher clouds are closing in
To hide the deeds of Fertile Jim

Could this be a brand new low
One that we can’t talk about
One that we can’t live without
One that we can join in now

I’m standing on two feet
Now buried in concrete
Just waiting for sundown
So as to be not found

The higher clouds are closing in
To hide the deeds of Fertile Jim

Could this be a brand new low
One that we can’t talk about
One that we can’t live without
One that we can join in now

All my dumb luck and all my misgivings
I thrust them aside for the dead for the living
I want my vehicle, my saucer-shaped coffin
I'm Mighty Pro-Jet
I'm Baron Von Richtofen

Yeah you know things could get much worse
You know things could get much worse
Could be better, yeah..

Her psychology today is to play the crying game
To elicit a response to determine every gain
And i'm wanting to attain something in this turnabout

When she speaks the flag unfurls
And the heavens split in half
When she launches her attack
In her opening paragraph

And she is having the time of my life
She is having - she is....?

Hey you know things could get much better
Could be better
Hey you know things could get much better
Could be better
Gotta be better, you know..

This is called "the coming of age"
Coming into town with the giggling faggots
Starting blizzards and other weird weather patterns
We participate in the shit
Now that's a hit
Now that's a hit!

Every street is dark and folding
Out mysteriously
Where lies the chance we take
To be always working, reaching out for
A hand that we can't see
Everybody's gotta hold on hope
It's the last thing that's holding me

Invitiation to the last dance
Then it's time to leave
But that's the price we pay
When we deceive one another, animal mother
She opens up for free
Everybody's gotta hold on hope
It's the last thing that's holding me

Look at the talkbox
In mute frustration
At the station
There hides the cowboy

Look at the talkbox
In mute frustration
At the station
There hides the cowboy
His campfire flickering
On the landscape

That nothing grows on
But time still goes on
Through each life of misery
Everybody's gotta hold on hope
It's the last thing that's holding me

Everybody's gotta hold on hope
It's the last thing that's holding me

Everybody's gotta hold on hope
It's the last thing that's holding me

How's my drinking?
I don't care about being sober
But I sure get around
In this town

To hell with my church bells
And leave me die
With you
I won't change

I am a tree - I show my age when I don't cry
I have the leaves that will fall off when wind blows by
Don't strip off my bark - I have been stripped of it before
Yesterday's gone and tomorrow has so much more in store

You are a bird - you're taking off in every way
Say the last word until there is nothing more to say

Don't interrupt - you know the squirrels are my friends
Get off my limb - for I will break before I bend

I'm planning to see
I'm planning to feel you all over me
So climb up my trunk and build on your nest
Come and get the sap out if me
I am a tree!
Fruitless and free!
No symmetry!
Touch me and see!

I am a tree - counting my rings will do no good
I won't live long but I would be with you if I could
When you take flight, remember me to one who lives there
Since you have flown, there's something special in the air

Jayhawk and crocus
Extremely out of focus
Leaves the purple blues
On peeling wallpaper
Try to smell the colour
The vain snappings of a most eloquent speaker
Can be a catalyst
To a great many money-making schemes
Do remember this, undecided college majors

I will ripple in the night sky
Like a bedsheet flapping in the wind
And watch their ghosts pass stigma'd by one another
Never thinking, considering
And behold they do not notice, but I will
Her isolation drills

I promise
It will make me work harder
It will make me work harder
It will make me work harder
And behold they do not notice, but I will
Her isolation drills

Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee, kicker of elves
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee, kicker of elves
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee, kicker of elves
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee, kicker of elves

On high seas you search of
The sickly sweet milk of selfish love
And knife these for warm fresh blood

Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee, kicker of elves
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee, kicker of elves
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee, kicker of elves
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee, kicker of elves

In studded crown the thief of souls
The parasites - the bugs of gold
This fertile land now spoiled and sold

Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee, kicker of elves
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee, kicker of elves

The scenario is bright
For the king & carol
What we must tell her
And seasons are slow
So wait we must
And hide from ourselves
Overrun by the rank
Roll over like an egg
And a man-child will kill them
And a quick procession follow

Oh, so now you know
We're all standing in line
For the king & caroline
And the wisdom they will sell us
And the wisdom they will sell
Sell
Sell
Sell

You are a child reaching out brave and true
For big things in the next room, and I
Couldn't step into such open sky
Along the crest of uncertainty you loom
I'm learning to hunt for you
I'm learning to hunt for you

Say that you'll never run too far away
Even with all the answers out there
Where it's brighter, but no one will care
Half as much as I care about you
I'm learning to hunt for you
I'm learning to hunt for you

Hey, little girl would you say that you know that
It's so hard to believe that it's so sad
And I know you're believing in something
But it's just so hard to believe in a nomad
I don't care what you do anymore
I don't care, I don't care

Hey little girl would you stop and just lay back
It's so hard to believe that you're so sad
And I know we just keep talking about it
In a swirl bunch of nothing turned inside out
I don't care what you do anymore
I don't care what you do anymore
I don't care what you do anymore
I don't care, I don't care

Hey little whirl I reach for you and you jump back
It's so hard to believe that you're so sad
I know that we've talked all around it
A little whirl we can do something about it
I don't care what you do anymore
I don't care what you do anymore
I don't care what you do anymore
I don't care, I don't care

Mincer ray don't worry
If the road's a little worn
It's a cold and filthy cavern
That we're traveling on

Richer day assured me
Of the weak-link mending plan
Danger's always there to follow
Just do the best you can
And a light shines down...

Mincer ray don't worry
If the road's a little worn
It's a cold and filthy cavern
That we're traveling on
And a light shines down
And a light shines down..

When you motor away beyond the once-red lips
When you free yourself from the chance of a lifetime
You can be anyone they told you to
You can belittle every little voice that told you so
And then the time will come when you add up the numbers
And then the time will come when you motor away
Oh, why don't you just drive away?

When you motor away down the icy streets
You can't lie to yourself that it's the chance of a lifetime
You can be anyone they told you to
You can belittle every little voice that told you so
And the time will come when you add up the numbers
And then the time will come when you motor away
Oh, why don't you just drive away?

Come on
Speed on

Paralyze the chains
Soft the shelled remains
Stun the strike brigade
They are played

Out with cheek and hair
Take the right to bear
Teeth to bite them down
In the ground

My kind of soldier
You can ride on my shoulders
When you've won
Fight for the moment
Of control, when it opens
Then it's gone

Introduce your pride
To the other side
Vaporize the trial
With denial

My kind of soldier
You can ride on my shoulders
When you've won
Fight for the moment
Of control, when it opens
Then it's gone

Decide now!
Decide now before you continue
The list is complete without your permission
I finally know how, I finally can't quit
And ancient ideas are on fire, my love

Completely the rope has been severed
The night screams for contact and clue
I must keep a journal
I must boast a victory
And the hellfire is dying around you, my love

I want to start a new life
With my valuable hunting knife
She will shine like a new girl
And I want to shout out our love to the world (Hit it!)
Everything I think about I think about
Everything I talk about I talk about
With you
But you don't know what I go through
You don't know

Days, they will turn into nights
But my valuable hunting knife
It will not rust through the tears
And it will not lose its appeal over years (Come on!)
Everything I think about I think about
Everything I talk about I talk about
With you
But you don't know what I go through
You don't know
I'll never know
I'll never know
And then I will run
And then I will. 
And then I will hide
And then I will. 

Do you see me, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Like I see you? Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Do you see me, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Like I see you? Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Do you see me?

Time lost, can't ever understand
The lines like most, we wants to be alone
But we can't be alone

Do you see me, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Like I see you? Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Do you see me, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Like I see you? Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Do you see me?

Can't believe the things we ask for
Can't believe the things we want
Do you see more than I do?
Do you see me?
Do you see more than I do?

Do you see me, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Do you see me?
Do you see me, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Do you see me?

Do you see more than I do?
Do you see more than I do?
Do you see more than I do?

Give me the cost of the albatross
And wear it 'round your neck for size
Don't let it get you down
I'm looking inside your house
And oh and it smells so nice
Your house always looks so nice

Maybe they're twice as high laughing
Maybe the time is right you know
Promise me not to leave
I'm looking inside your brain
And Christ, it's a cluttered mess
I love you, i must confess

Pivotal film
Showing cloaks of rubber
Digital relay
Fingers stroking

Like mechanical lover
Critical rooms
Transparent scenes shifting

Pivotal film
Selling out your monkey
Sinful heroes
Stabbing, choking
(They must be joking)

Like mechanical lover
Critical rooms
Transparent scenes shifting

Grotesque and arrogant
Perfect for the experts
Top gold
It's cold in the morning
Where scenesters exit
Into thin air

Oh yeah, I'm going to drive my car
Oh yeah, I'm going to go real far

As we were sitting there in the final stages
Staring at the screen as the battle rages
You were finding God in the dictionary
Taking photographs in the cemetery

Oh yeah, I'm going to drive my car
Oh yeah, I'm going to go real far
Beyond the shadow of a doubt
Beyond the power of your clout

The worst offense is intelligence
Your best defense is belligerence
How we stalemate our predicament
Governed by tissue and filament

Oh yeah, I'm going to drive my car
Oh yeah, I'm going to go real far
Beyond the shadow of a doubt
Beyond the power of your clout
Beyond the secret bogus world
Beyond the Montezuma Halls

Beyond the shadow of a doubt
Beyond the power of your clout
Beyond the secret bogus world
Beyond the Montezuma Halls

Beyond the shadow of a doubt
Beyond the power of your clout
Beyond the secret bogus world
Beyond the Montezuma Halls

Beyond the shadow of a doubt
Beyond the power of your clout
Beyond the secret bogus world
Beyond the Montezuma Halls

Beyond the shadow of a doubt
Beyond the power of your clout
Beyond the secret bogus world

To see the light and try but fail
On jagged seas that can't be sailed
And sought to lead but always trailed
Asked questions anyway

And all around the breeding grounds
The nymphos sweetly played
The queen of cans and jars will keep them safe

To be so keen on global trend
To be so tight on how and when
To scratch and claw until the end
To work for each new day

And all around the hunting ground
The dead were on display
The queen of cans and jars will keep them safe

Were you there?
Were you kicking?
Alive in aisle twelve
Gimmick of the century
In boxes and jars
And giveaway cars
He motioning for you

Twas a band
They were sickening
Arousing everyone
PS Dump Your Boyfriend
Promotional trash
Emotional bash
With helium balloons

So now tell me
How the hell did we miss it
Bared his ass for all to see
And no one got to kiss it

Sister, I need wine
For color in my skin
And darkness for my eyes
But I can see the light burn through
Still it is the night brings me to you

Sister, use your gift
The backed up river spreads
On ground for fighting words
And I am hating the ignorance in my body
And I can't feed on the heaviness
Sister, I need you

And we will dance for gold
And straddle the hour of fear
And learn the real story
Drink the truth
Shed not one tear

Reinvented nightly
Wake up with skills like this
And do you want me in your head?
But what's behind your scattered eyesigns?
I want to reinvent you now

Fifty hats and bargain suits
We will wear them if we must
But who would be a human boot
To kick the wave of current hotlines?
I want to reinvent you now
I want to reinvent you now

Reinvent you nightly
Reinvite you rightly
I'll reunite you
Come on

Reinvented nightly
Wake up with skills like this
And do you want me in your head?
But what's behind your scattered eyesigns?
I want to reinvent you now

I want to reinvent you now
I want to reinvent you now
I want to reinvent you now

In the summer that you came
There was something eating everyone
And the sunshine fund was low
We couldn't greet you
With a simple hello

And the watchers of the flood
Were busy in their chambers
Making sure there was new blood
To sustain their dying veins

But I believed you
No need for further questioning
I'm gonna leave with you
You can teach me all you know
Which way will we go now
On our trip to taller windows
I really don't know now
I really don't know

In the winter that you left
There was business as usual
With the same old fears and frustrations
But the word got out
It was really such a pity

But the judges and the saints
And the textbook committee
Decided you should be left out
Not even mentioned

Send in the striped white jets
In through stained glass ceilings, ah-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh
Color them white or red

Don't let anyone find out
Or expose your feelings, ah-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh
Cover your head instead

And penetrate this dark heart
And as the wound is healing, ah-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh
Crawl to the other side

Where things are new in brilliant blue
And striped white jets come speeding through, ah-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh

And we must not forget
The sudden pain of birth and greed
And what's expected of this superbreed

And those who dream to touch the sun
And those who run
Who always run

Perfect striped white jets
In their hangars bleeding, ah-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh
Cover them all in black

With surgical focus
She stared at me and said
"I'm willing to reach out into your head
And I will keep you and cleanse you"
She glared at me and wept
A change is not going to hurt you
Not this time

And I've been waiting in line for this
Now that it's taken forever, I insist
Until I get it, I can't breathe
Climbing high upon the rocky cliffs, she flies
With surgical focus
With surgical focus

With surgical focus
She stared at me and said
"I'm willing to reach out, get into your head
And I will keep you and cleanse you"
She glared at me and wept
A change is not going to hurt you
Not this time

And I've been waiting in line for this
Now that it's taken forever, I insist
Until I get it, I can't breathe
Climbing high upon the rocky cliffs, she flies
With surgical focus
With surgical focus

Well, I've been waiting in line for this
Now that it's taken forever, I insist
Until I get it, I can't breathe
Climbing high upon the rocky cliffs, she flies
With surgical focus
With surgical focus
With surgical focus

Cold hands touching my face
Don't hide - the snake can see you
Old friends you might not remember
Fading away from you

The goldheart mountaintop queen directory
The goldheart mountaintop queen directory

And we looked
And we passed
Through the hallways of shatterproof glass

She runs through the night as if nobody cares
She screams and she cries and ignores all the stares
She wants me to come, but i'm never going there

The goldheart mountaintop queen directory
The goldheart mountaintop queen directory

Bitter fish in crude oil sea
You don't have to bother me
You just have to join in on this song
Crawling people on your knees
Don't take this so seriously
You just have to hum it all day long

To dine alone
To build a private zone
Or trigger a synapse
And free us from our traps

You won't see me turn my back
With my head against my stack
Spitting teeth and breaking open skin
Official ironmen, you are free
Champions officially
But you won't catch me on an open chin

To dine alone
To build a private zone
Or trigger a synapse
And free us from our traps

Knockout punches for the freaks
Happy little babies with red cheeks
You will rock them gently out of sync
Confirmations through the wire
Spitting gas into the fire
Am I also worthy of a drink?

To dine alone
To build a private zone
Or trigger a synapse
And free us from our traps

Coded ancient, the crease
Unlock the timers
And strike the chimers
In my sleep

Grab the coat, steel the fleece
From behind the curtain
It will most certain-
Ly bring peace

To those with countless numbers
No longer cold or hot, like
Things that I will keep
And hide them in my sleep

Dead even countless numbers
No longer cold or hot, like
Things that I will keep
And hide them in my sleep

Coded ancient, oh brightness
We shall see
Loaded up and at night when
We shall flee
Not to tread through the heavy life
Sink in the dream
On the right night
You'll find her waiting

Selling things for cheap
The things that I will keep

To remake the young flyer
Yes, we must define his high desire
Stand erect and not detect
The anythings that we could not admire

From a long line of highmen
Number one, is that the one to send?
To restore all the trial
This and then the national pride, so proud

A question to the lunatic
Does your day seem like nights?
Do your world go together?

Gallant men dash forth
He takes his place
He ends the laughter of the slaughter daughters
Takes his softness from his hand and goes

To remake the young flyer
Yes, we must define his high desire

Twilight campfighter
You build your fire into an open wound
You want us to feel better
On these darker trails
With light revealing holy grails
To hike through dangerous weather
You need twilight eyes

Sunspot solider, you come from another day
Accept no pay
You want us to feel better
All for longing causes
Racing minds and lengthy pauses
All who must soon shed their veils
And wipe their eyes

As we vegetate and wait around for brighter days
And can dance contented to the sound of money
Could I have seen a sight
Much greater than your twilight eyes
That penetrate your silent lives (lies)

Twilight campfighter
We do congratulate
It's not too late
To make us all feel better
Under darker skies
With your twilight eyes

In a world you think you understand
Stay put and tune to another planet
It's up to you to stay put
The shoe is on the other foot

Driven to the fields
Whipped like a slave
Ready for out
Ready for the beast, unleashed
Large-hearted boy

In a world you think you understand
Stay put and tune to another planet
It's up to you to stay put
The shoe is on the other foot

Driven to the fields
Whipped like a slave
Ready for the out
Ready for the beast, unleashed
Large-hearted boy

Well, come on now and see the course
That never fields the game of choice
And cold allies of steel
Couldn't buy the way it feels
Rusty and divided steel
The race is yet to come

Traveller's diagram
For where I am, for what I am
Check the provisional codes
It overloads, it all explodes

And hey, let's throw the great party
Today for the rest of our lives
The fun is just about to get started
So throw the switch, it's rock and roll time

Special elixirs flow
And then the onion lady blows
Kisses to the crying cooks
With baited hooks and lady looks

And hey, let's throw the great party
Today for the rest of our lives
The fun is just about to get started
So throw the switch, it's rock and roll time

You must be willing just to ride along with me
You must be happy just to do the job for free
Yours for the taking if you follow simple rules
Such acts of subservience were never taught in schools

Spit me out from your cosmos
Draft me into your troops
Set me up for the knockdown
You can watch, come watch
And I'll be back when it's over

I'm much greater than you think
I'm a swimmer in the drink
I'm much greater than you think
I'm a swimmer in the drink

And oh, mesh gear fox
Put out another bag of tricks from scientific box
Time's wasting and you're not gonna live forever
And if you do
I'll come back and marry you
No use changing now, you couldn't anyhow and ever

It's not the way that I feel, that I feel
It's the way you act
It's the way you look when you're near me
It's not so hard to conceal, to conceal
It's the things you say
It's the things you do, go right through me
